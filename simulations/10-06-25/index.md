# 🌊 CFD Simulation – Aircraft  
**Date:** 10 June 2025

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation to analyze airflow behavior around a small aircraft model during various flight stages.

## 📂 Simulation Assets

- Visual results: *To be added*
- Input parameters: *To be added*

## 📝 Overview

This simulation was conducted using ANSYS Fluent, focusing on lift, drag, and vortex formation. Boundary conditions and turbulence models were chosen to reflect realistic subsonic conditions.
